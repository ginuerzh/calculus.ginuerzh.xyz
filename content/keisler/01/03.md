# 1.3 Straight Lines

## DEFINITION

_Let_ \\(P(x_0, y_0)\\) _be a point and let \\(m\\) be a real number. The **line** through \\(P\\) with slope \\(m\\) is the set of all points \\(Q(x, y)\\) with_

$$
y - y_0 = m(x - x_0).
$$

_This equation is called the **point-slope equation** of the line (See Figure 1.3.1.)_

_The **vertical line** through \\(P\\) is the set of all points \\(Q(x, y)\\) with_ \\(x = x_0\\). _Vertical lines do not have slopes._

**Figure 1.3.1**

The slope is a measure of the direction of the line. Figure 1.3.2 shows lines with zero, positive, and negative slopes.

![figure 1.3.2](/calculus/img/keisler/f1.3.2.gif)

**Figure 1.3.2**

The line that crosses the y-axis at the point \\((0, b)\\) and has slope \\(m\\) has the simple equation.

$$
y = mx + b.
$$

This is called the _slope-intercept_ equation for the line. We can get it from the point-slope equation by setting \\(x_0 = 0\\) and \\(y_0 = b\\).

### EXAMPLE 1

The line through the point \\(P(-1, 2)\\) with slope \\(m = -\frac{1}{2}\\) (Figure 1.3.3) has the point-slope equation

$$
y - 2 = (x - (-1)) \cdot (-\frac{1}{2}),
$$

or

$$
y - 2 = -\frac{1}{2}(x + 1).
$$

The slope-intercept equation is

$$
y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 1\frac{1}{2}
$$

![figure 1.3.3](/calculus/img/keisler/f1.3.3.gif)

**Figure 1.3.3**

We now describe the functions whose graphs are nonvertical lines.

## DEFINITION

_A **linear function** is a function \\(f\\) of the form_

$$
f(x) = mx + b,
$$

_where \\(m\\) and \\(b\\) are constants._

The graph of a linear function is just the line with slope-intercept equation

$$
y = mx + b.
$$

This is the line through \\((0, b)\\) with slope \\(m\\).

If two points on a line are known, the slope can be found as follows.

## THEOREM 1

_Suppose a line \\(L\\) passes through two distinct points_ \\(P(x_1,y_1)\\) _and_ \\(Q(x_2,y_2)\\). _If_ \\(x_1 = x_2\\), _then the line \\(L\\) is vertical._ _If_ \\(x_1 \ne x_2\\), _then the slope of the line \\(L\\) is equal to the change in \\(y\\) divided by the change in \\(x\\),_

$$
m = \frac{\Delta{y}}{\Delta{x}} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}.
$$

### PROOF

Suppose \\(x_1 \ne x_2\\), so \\(L\\) is not vertical. Let \\(m\\) be the slope of \\(L\\). \\(L\\) has the point-slope formula

$$
y - y_1 = m(x - x_1).
$$

Substituting \\(y_2\\) for \\(y\\) and \\(x_2\\) for \\(x\\), we see that

$$
m = (y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1).
$$

Theorem 1 shows why the slope of a line is a measure of its direction. Sometimes \\(\Delta{x}\\) is called the _run_ and \\(\Delta{y}\\) the _rise_. Thus the slope is equal to the rise divided by the run. A large positive slope means that the line is rising steeply to the right, and a small positive slope means the line rises slowly to the right. A negative slope means that the line goes downward to the right. These cases are illustrated in Figure 1.3.4.

![figure 1.3.4](/calculus/img/keisler/f1.3.4.gif)

**Figure 1.3.4**

There is exactly one line \\(L\\) passing through two distinct points \\(P(x_1,y_2)\\) and \\(Q(x_2, y_2)\\). If \\(x_1 \ne x_2\\), we see from Theorem 1 that \\(L\\) has the equation

$$
y - y_1 = \Bigl(\frac{y_2 -y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\Bigr)(x - x_1).
$$

This is called the _two-point_ equation for the line.

### EXAMPLE 2

Given \\(P(3, 1)\\) and \\(Q(1, 4)\\), find the changes in \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), the slope, and the equation of the line through \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\). (See Figure 1.3.5.)

$$
\Delta{x} = 1 - 3 = -2,
$$

$$
\Delta{y} = 4 - 1 = 3.
$$

The line through \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) has slope \\(\Delta{y}/\Delta{x} = -\frac{3}{2}\\), and its equation is

$$
y - 1 = -\frac{3}{2}(x - 3).
$$

![figure 1.3.5](/calculus/img/keisler/f1.3.5.gif)

**Figure 1.3.5**

### EXAMPLE 3

Given \\(P(1, -1)\\) and \\(Q(1, 2)\\), as in Figure 1.3.6,

$$
\Delta{x} = 1 - 1 = 0,
$$

$$
\Delta{y} = 2 - (-1) = 3.
$$

The line through \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) is the vertical line \\(x = 1\\).

![figure 1.3.6](/calculus/img/keisler/f1.3.6.gif)

**Figure 1.3.6**

### EXAMPLE 4

A particle moves along the y-axis with constant velocity. At time \\(t = 0\\) sec, it is at the point \\(y = 3\\) ft. At time \\(t = 2\\) sec, it is at the point \\(y = 11\\) ft. Find the velocity and the equation for the motion.

The velocity is defined as the distance moved divided by the time elapsed, so the velocity is

$$
v = \frac{\Delta{y}}{\Delta{t}} = \frac{11 - 3}{2 - 0} = 4 \ ft/sec.
$$

If the motion of the particle is plotted in the \\((t, y)\\) plane as in Figure 1.3.7,

the result is a line through the points \\(P(0, 3)\\) and \\(Q(2, 11)\\). The velocity, being the ratio of \\(\Delta{y}\\) to \\(\Delta{t}\\), is just the slope of this line. The line has the equation

$$
y - 3 = 4t.
$$

![figure 1.3.7](/calculus/img/keisler/f1.3.7.gif)

**Figure 1.3.7**

Suppose a particle moving with constant velocity is at the point \\(y = y_1\\) at time \\(t = t_1\\) and at the point \\(y = y_2\\) at time \\(t = t_2\\). Then the velocity is \\(v = \Delta{y}/\Delta{t}\\). The motion of the particle plotted on the \\((t, y)\\) plane is the line passing through the two points \\((t_1, y_1)\\) and \\((t_2, y_2)\\), and the velocity is the slope of this line.

An equation of the form

$$
Ax + By + C = 0
$$

where A and B are not both zero is called a _linear equation_. The reason for this name is explained by the next theorem.

## THEOREM 2

_Every linear equation determines a line._

### PROOF

_Case 1_

\\(B = 0\\). The equation \\(Ax + C = 0\\) can be solved for \\(x\\), \\(x = -C / A\\). This is a vertical line.

_Case 2_

\\(B \ne 0\\). In this case, we can solve the given equation for \\(y\\), and the result is

$$
y = \frac{-Ax - C}{B},
$$

$$
y = -\frac{A}{B}x - \frac{C}{B}.
$$

This is a line with slope \\(-A / B\\) crossing the y-axis at \\(-C / B\\).

### EXAMPLE 5

Find the slope of the line

$$
6x - 2y + 7 = 0.
$$

The answer is

$$
m = -A / B = -6 / (-2) = 3.
$$

To draw the graph of a linear equation, find two points on the line and draw the line through them with a ruler.

### EXAMPLE 6

Draw the graph of the line

$$
4x + 2y + 3 = 0.
$$

First solve for \\(y\\) as a function of \\(x\\):

$$
y = -2x - \frac{3}{2}.
$$

Next select any two values for \\(x\\), say \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 1\\), and compute the corresponding values of \\(y\\).

When

$$
x = 0, \ \ y = -\frac{3}{2}.
$$

When

$$
x = 1, \ \ y = -\frac{7}{2}.
$$

Finally, plot the two points \\((0, -\frac{3}{2})\\) and \\((1, -\frac{7}{2})\\), and draw the line through them. (See Figure 1.3.8.)
