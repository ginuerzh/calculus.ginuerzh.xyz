In Section 1.3 the slope of the line through the points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is shown to be the ratio of the change in \\(y\\) to the change in \\(x\\),

$$
slope = \frac{\Delta{y}}{\Delta{x}} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}.
$$

If the line has the equation

$$
y = mx + b,
$$

then the constant \\(m\\) is the slope.

What is meant by the slope of a _curve_? The differential calculus is needed to answer this question, as well as to provide a method of computing the value of the slope. We shall do this in the next chapter. However, to provide motivation, we now describe intuitively the method of finding the slope.

Consider the parabola

$$
y = x^2.
$$

The slope will measure the direction of a curve just as it measures the direction of a line. The slope of this curve will be different at different points on the \\(x\\)-axis, because the direction of the curve changes.

If \\((x_0, y_0)\\) and \\((x_0 + \Delta{x}, y_0 + \Delta{y})\\) are two points on the curve, then the "average slope" of the curve between these two points is defined as the ratio of the change in \\(y\\) to the change in \\(x\\),

$$
average\ slope = \frac{\Delta{y}}{\Delta{x}}.
$$

This is exactly the same as the slope of the straight line through the points \\((x_0, y_0)\\) and \\((x_0 + \Delta{x}, y_0 + \Delta{y})\\), as shown in Figure 1.4.1.

![figure 1.4.1](/calculus/img/keisler/f1.4.1.gif)

**Figure 1.4.1**

Let us compute the average slope. The two points \\((x_0, y_0)\\) and \\((x_0 + \Delta{x}, y_0 + \Delta{y})\\) are on the curve, so

$$
y_0 = x_0^2,
$$

$$
y_0 + \Delta{y} = (x_0 + \Delta{x})^2.
$$

Subtracting,

$$
\Delta{y} = (x_0 + \Delta{x})^2 - x_0^2.
$$

Dividing by \\(\Delta{x}\\),

$$
\frac{\Delta{y}}{\Delta{x}} = \frac{(x_0 + \Delta{x})^2 - x_0^2}{\Delta{x}}.
$$

This can be simplified,

$$
\frac{\Delta{y}}{\Delta{x}} = \frac{x_0^2 + 2x_0\ \Delta{x} + (\Delta{x})^2 - x_0^2}{\Delta{x}}
$$

$$
= \frac{2x_0\ \Delta{x} + (\Delta{x})^2}{\Delta{x}} = 2x_0 + \Delta{x}.
$$

Thus the average slope is

$$
\frac{\Delta{y}}{\Delta{x}} = 2x_0 + \Delta{x}.
$$

Notice that this computation can only be carried out when \\(\Delta{x} \ne 0\\), because at \\(\Delta{x} = 0\\) the quotient \\(\Delta{y}/\Delta{x}\\) is undefined.

Reasoning in a nonrigorous way, the actual slope of the curve at the point \\((x_0, y_0)\\) can be found thus. Let \\(\Delta{x}\\) be very small (but not zero). Then the point \\((x_0 + \Delta{x}, y_0 + \Delta{y})\\) is close to \\((x_0, y_0)\\), so the average slope between these two points is close to the slope of the curve at \\((x_0, y_0)\\);

[slope at \\((x_0, y_0)\\)] is close to \\(2x_0 + \Delta{x}\\).

We neglect the term \\(\Delta{x}\\) because it is very small, and we are left with

[slope at \\((x_0, y_0)\\)] = \\(2x_0\\).

For example, at the point \\((0, 0)\\) the slope is zero, at the point \\((1, 1)\\) the slope is 2, and at the point \\(( -3, 9)\\) the slope is -6. (See Figure 1.4.2.)

![figure 1.4.2](/calculus/img/keisler/f1.4.2.gif)

**Figure 1.4.2**

The whole process can also be visualized in another way. Let \\(t\\) represent time, and suppose a particle is moving along the \\(y\\)-axis according to the equation \\(y = t^2\\). That is, at each time \\(t\\) the particle is at the point \\(t^2\\) on the \\(y\\)-axis. We then ask: what is meant by the _velocity_ of the particle at time \\(t_0\\)? Again we have the difficulty that the velocity is different at different times, and the calculus is needed to answer the question in a satisfactory way. Let us consider what happens to the particle between a time \\(t_0\\) and a later time \\(t_0 + \Delta{t}\\). The time elapsed is \\(\Delta{t}\\), and the distance moved is \\(\Delta{y} = 2t_0\ \Delta{t} + (\Delta{t})^2\\). If the velocity were constant during the entire interval of time, then it would just be the ratio \\(\Delta{y}/\Delta{t}\\). However, the velocity is changing during the time interval. We shall call the ratio \\(\Delta{y}/\Delta{t}\\) of the distance moved to the time elapsed the "average velocity" for the interval;

$$
v_{ave} = \frac{\Delta{y}}{\Delta{t}} = 2t_0 + \Delta{t}.
$$

The average velocity is not the same as the velocity at time \\(t_0\\) which we are after. As a matter of fact, for \\(t_0 > 0\\), the particle is speeding up; the velocity at time \\(t_0\\) will be somewhat less than the average velocity for the interval of time between \\(t_0\\) and \\(t_0 + \Delta{t}\\), and the velocity at time \\(t_0 + \Delta{t}\\) will be somewhat greater than the average.

But for a very small increment of time \\(\Delta{t}\\), the velocity will change very little, and the average velocity \\(\Delta{y}/\Delta{t}\\) will be close to the velocity at time \\(t_0\\). To get the velocity \\(v_0\\) at time \\(t_0\\), we neglect the small term \\(\Delta{t}\\) in the formula

$$
v_{ave} = 2t_0 + \Delta{t},
$$

and we are left with the value

$$
v_0 = 2t_0.
$$

When we plot \\(y\\) against \\(t\\), the velocity is the same as the slope of the curve \\(y = t^2\\), and the average velocity is the same as the average slope.

The trouble with the above intuitive argument, whether stated in terms of slope or velocity, is that it is not clear when something is to be "neglected." Nevertheless, the basic idea can be made into a useful and mathematically sound method of rinding the slope of a curve or the velocity. What is needed is a sharp distinction between numbers which are small enough to be neglected and numbers which aren't. Actually, no real number except zero is small enough to be neglected. To get around this difficulty, we take the bold step of introducing a new kind of number, which is infinitely small and yet not equal to zero.

A number \\(\varepsilon\\) is said to be _infinitely small_, or _infinitesimal_, if

$$
-a < \varepsilon < a
$$

for every positive real number \\(a\\). Then the only _real_ number that is infinitesimal is zero. We shall use a new number system called the _hyperreal numbers_, which contains all the real numbers and also has infinitesimals that are not zero. Just as the real numbers can be constructed from the rational numbers, the hyperreal numbers can be constructed from the real numbers. This construction is sketched in the Epilogue at the end of the book. In this chapter, we shall simply list the properties of the hyperreal numbers needed for the calculus.

First we shall give an intuitive picture of the hyperreal numbers and show how they can be used to find the slope of a curve. The set of all hyperreal numbers is denoted by \\(R^\*\\). Every real number is a member of \\(R^\*\\), but \\(R^\*\\) has other elements too. The infinitesimals in \\(R^\*\\) are of three kinds: positive, negative, and the real number 0. The symbols \\(\Delta{x}, \Delta{y}\\),... and the Greek letters \\(\varepsilon\\) (epsilon) and \\(\delta\\) (delta) will be used for infinitesimals. If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are hyperreal numbers whose difference \\(a - b\\) is infinitesimal, we say that \\(a\\) is _infinitely close to_ \\(b\\). For example, if \\(\Delta{x}\\) is infinitesimal then \\(x_0 + \Delta{x}\\) is infinitely close to \\(x_0\\). If \\(\varepsilon\\) is positive infinitesimal, then \\(-\varepsilon\\) will be a negative infinitesimal. \\(1/\varepsilon\\) will be an _infinite positive number_, that is, it will be greater than any real number. On the other hand, (-1/\varepsilon\\) will be an _infinite negative number_, i.e., a number less than every real number. Hyperreal numbers which are not infinite numbers are called _finite numbers_. Figure 1.4.3 shows a drawing of the hyperreal line. The circles represent "infinitesimal microscopes" which are powerful enough to show an infinitely small portion of the hyperreal line. The set \\(R\\) of real numbers is scattered among the finite numbers. About each real number \\(c\\) is a portion of the hyperreal line composed of the numbers infinitely close to \\(c\\) (shown under an infinitesimal microscope for \\(c = 0\\) and \\(c = 100\\)). The numbers infinitely close to 0 are the infinitesimals.

**Figure 1.4.3**

In Figure 1.4.3 the finite and infinite parts of the hyperreal line were separated from each other by a dotted line. Another way to represent the infinite parts of the hyperreal line is with an "infinite telescope" as in Figure 1.4.4. The field of view of an infinite telescope has the same scale as the finite portion of the hyperreal line, while the field of view of an infinitesimal microscope contains an infinitely small portion of the hyperreal line blown up.

**Figure 1.4.4**

We have no way of knowing what a line in physical space is really like. It might be like the hyperreal line, the real line, or neither. However, in applications of the calculus it is helpful to imagine a line in physical space as a hyperreal line. The hyperreal line is, like the real line, a useful mathematical model for a line in physical space.

The hyperreal numbers can be algebraically manipulated just like the real numbers. Let us try to use them to find slopes of curves. We begin with the parabola \\(y = x^2\\).

Consider a real point \\((x_0, y_0)\\) on the curve \\(y = x^2\\). Let \\(\Delta{x}\\) be either a positive or a negative infinitesimal (but not zero), and let \\(\Delta{y}\\) be the corresponding change in \\(y\\). Then the slope at \\((x_0, y_0)\\) is _defined_ in the following way:

[slope at \\((x_0, y_0)\\)] = \\(\Bigl[\\)the real number infinitely close to \\(\frac{\Delta{y}}{\Delta{x}}\\)\\(\Bigr]\\).

We compute \\(\frac{\Delta{y}}{\Delta{x}}\\) as before:

$$
\frac{\Delta{y}}{\Delta{x}} = \frac{(x_0 + \Delta{x})^2 - x_0^2}{\Delta{x}} = 2x_0 + \Delta{x}.
$$

This is a hyperreal number, not a real number. Since \\(\Delta{x}\\) is infinitesimal, the hyperreal number \\(2x_0 + \Delta{x}\\) is infinitely close to the real number \\(2x_0\\). We conclude that

[slope at \\((x_0, y_0)\\)] = \\(2x_0\\).

The process can be illustrated by the picture in Figure 1.4.5, with the infinitesimal changes \\(\Delta{x}\\) and \\(\Delta{y}\\) shown under a microscope.

![figure 1.4.5](/calculus/img/keisler/f1.4.5.gif)

**Figure 1.4.5**

The same method can be applied to other curves. The third degree curve \\(y = x^3\\) is shown in Figure 1.4.6. Let \\((x_0, y_0)\\) be any point on the curve \\(y = x^3\\), and let \\(\Delta{x}\\) be a positive or a negative infinitesimal. Let \\(\Delta{y}\\) be the corresponding change in \\(y\\) along the curve.

![figure 1.4.6](/calculus/img/keisler/f1.4.6.gif)

**Figure 1.4.6**

In Figure 1.4.7, \\(\Delta{x}\\) and \\(\Delta{y}\\) are shown under a microscope. We again define the slope at \\((x_0, y_0)\\) by

[slope at \\((x_0, y_0)\\)] = \\(\Bigl[\\)the real number infinitely close to \\(\frac{\Delta{y}}{\Delta{x}}\\)\\(\Bigr]\\).

![figure 1.4.7](/calculus/img/keisler/f1.4.7.gif)

**Figure 1.4.7**

We now compute the hyperreal number \\(\frac{\Delta{y}}{\Delta{x}}\\).

$$
y_0 = x_0^3,
$$

$$
y_0 + \Delta{y} = (x_0 + \Delta{x})^3,
$$

$$
\Delta{y} = (x_0 + \Delta{x})^3 - x_0^3,
$$

$$
\frac{\Delta{y}}{\Delta{x}} = \frac{(x_0 + \Delta{x})^3 - x_0^3}{\Delta{x}}
$$

$$
= \frac{x_0^3 + 3x_0^2\ \Delta{x} + 3x_0(\Delta{x})^2 + (\Delta{x})^3 - x_0^3}{\Delta{x}}
$$

$$
= \frac{3x_0^2\ \Delta{x} + 3x_0(\Delta{x})^2 + (\Delta{x})^3}{\Delta{x}},
$$

and finally

$$
\frac{\Delta{y}}{\Delta{x}} = 3x_0^2 + 3x_0\ \Delta{x} + (\Delta{x})^2.
$$

In the next section we shall develop some rules about infinitesimals which will enable us to show that since \\(\Delta{x}\\) is infinitesimal,

$$
3x_0\ \Delta{x} + (\Delta{x})^2
$$

is infinitesimal as well. Therefore the hyperreal number

$$
3x_0^2 + 3x_0\ \Delta{x} + (\Delta{x})^2
$$

is infinitely close to the real number \\(3x_0^2\\), whence

[slope at \\((x_0,y_0\\)] = \\(3x_0^2\\).

For example, at \\((0, 0)\\) the slope is zero, at \\((1, 1)\\) the slope is 3, and at \\((2, 8)\\) the slope is 12.

We shall return to the study of the slope of a curve in Chapter 2 after we have learned more about hyperreal numbers. From the last example it is evident that we need to know how to show that two numbers are infinitely close to each other. This is our next topic.
