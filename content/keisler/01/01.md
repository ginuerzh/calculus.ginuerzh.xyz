# 1.1 The Real Line

Familiarity with the real number system is a prerequisite for this course. A review of the rules of algebra for the real numbers is given in the appendix. For convenience, these rules are also listed in a table inside the front cover. The letter \\(R\\) is used for the set of all real numbers. We think of the real numbers as arranged along a straight line with the integers (whole numbers) marked off at equal intervals, as shown in Figure 1.1.1. This line is called the _real line_.

![figure 1.1.1](/calculus/img/keisler/f1.1.1.gif)

**Figure 1.1.1** The real line.

In grade school and high school mathematics, the real number system is constructed gradually in several stages. Beginning with the positive integers, the systems of integers, rational numbers, and finally real numbers are built up. One way to construct the set of real numbers is as the set of all nonterminating decimals.

After constructing the real numbers, it is possible to prove the familiar rules for sums, differences, products, quotients, exponents, roots, and order. In this course, we take it for granted that these rules are familiar to the student, so that we can proceed as quickly as possible to the calculus.

Before going on, we pause to recall two special points that are important in the calculus. First, _division by zero is never allowed_. Expressions such as

$$
\frac{2}{0}, \ \ \frac{0}{0}, \ \ \frac{x}{0}, \ \ \frac{5}{1 + 3 - 4}
$$

are always considered to be _undefined_.

Second, a positive real number \\(c\\) always has two square roots, \\(\sqrt{c}\\) and \\(-\sqrt{c}\\), and \\(\sqrt{c}\\) always stands for the positive square root. Negative real numbers do not have real square roots. _For each positive real number \\(c\\), \\(\sqrt{c}\\) is positive and \\(\sqrt{-c}\\) is undefined_.

On the other hand, every real number has one real cube root. If \\(c > 0\\), \\(c\\) has the positive cube root \\(\sqrt[3]{c}\\), and \\(-c\\) has the negative cube root \\(\sqrt[3]{-c}\\) = \\(-\sqrt[3]{c}\\).

In calculus, we often deal with sets of real numbers. By a set \\(S\\) of real numbers, we mean any collection of real numbers, called _members_ of \\(S\\), _elements_ of \\(S\\), or _points_ in \\(S\\).

A simple but important kind of set is an _interval_. Given two real numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(a < b\\), the _closed interval_ \\([a, b]\\) is defined as the set of all real numbers \\(x\\) such that \\(a \le x\\) and \\(x \le b\\), or more concisely, \\(a \le x \le b\\).

The _open interval_ \\((a, b)\\) is defined as the set of all real numbers \\(x\\) such that \\(a < x < b\\). Closed and open intervals are illustrated in Figure 1.1.2.

![figure 1.1.2](/calculus/img/keisler/f1.1.2.gif)

**Figure 1.1.2**

For both open and closed intervals, the number \\(a\\) is called the _lower endpoint_, and \\(b\\) the _upper endpoint_. The difference between the closed interval \\([a, b]\\) and the open interval \\((a, b)\\) is that the endpoints \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are elements of \\([a, b]\\) but are not elements of \\((a, b)\\). When \\(a \le x \le b\\), we say that \\(x\\) is _between_ \\(a\\) and \\(b\\); when \\(a < x < b\\), we say that \\(x\\) is _strictly between_ \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

Three other types of sets are also counted as open intervals: the set \\((a, \infty)\\) of all real numbers \\(x\\) greater than \\(a\\); the set \\((-\infty, b)\\) of all real numbers \\(x\\) less than \\(b\\), and the whole real line \\(R\\). The real line \\(R\\) is sometimes denoted by \\((-\infty, \infty)\\). The symbols \\(\infty\\) and \\(-\infty\\), read "infinity" and "minus infinity," do not stand for numbers; they are only used to indicate an interval with no upper endpoint, or no lower endpoint.

Besides the open and closed intervals, there is one other kind of interval, called a _half-open interval_. The set of all real numbers \\(x\\) such that \\(a \le x < b\\) is a half-open interval denoted by \\([a, b)\\). The set of all real numbers \\(x\\) such that \\(a \le x\\) is also a half-open interval and is written \\([a, \infty)\\). Here is a table showing the various kinds of intervals.

![Table 1.1.1](/calculus/img/keisler/t1.1.1.jpg)

**Table 1.1.1** Kinds of Intervals

We list some other important examples of sets of real numbers.

(1) The empty set \\(\varnothing\\), which has no elements.

(2) The finite set \\(\\{a_1,\cdots, a_n\\}\\), whose only elements are the numbers \\(a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n\\).

(3) The set of all \\(x\\) such that \\(x \ne 0\\).

(4) The set \\(N = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, \cdots\\}\\) of all positive integers.

(5) The set \\(Z = \\{\cdots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \cdots\\}\\) of all integers.

(6) The set \\(Q\\) of all rational numbers. A rational number is a quotient \\(m/n\\) where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are integers and \\(n \ne 0\\).

While real numbers correspond to points on a line, ordered pairs of real numbers correspond to points on a plane. This correspondence gives us a way to draw pictures of calculus problems and to translate physical problems into the language of calculus. It is the starting point of the subject called _analytic geometry_.

An _ordered pair_ of real numbers, \\((a, b)\\), is given by the first number \\(a\\) and the second number \\(b\\). For example, \\((1, 3)\\), \\((3, 1)\\), and \\((1, 1)\\) are three different ordered pairs. Following tradition, we use the same symbol for the open interval \\((a, b)\\) and the ordered pair \\((a, b)\\). However the open interval and ordered pair are completely different things. It will always be quite obvious from the context whether \\((a, b)\\) stands for the open interval or the ordered pair.

We now explain how ordered pairs of real numbers correspond to points in a plane. A system of _rectangular coordinates_ in a plane is given by a horizontal and a vertical copy of the real line crossing at zero. The horizontal line is called the _horizontal axis_, or _x-axis_, while the vertical line is called the _vertical axis_, or _y-axis_. The point where the two axes meet is called the _origin_ and corresponds to the ordered pair \\((0, 0)\\). Now consider any point \\(P\\) in the plane. A vertical line through \\(P\\) will cross the x-axis at a real number \\(x_0\\), and a horizontal line through \\(P\\) will cross the y-axis at a real number \\(y_0\\). The ordered pair \\((x_0, y_0)\\) obtained in this way corresponds to the point \\(P\\). (See Figure 1.1.3.) We sometimes call \\(P\\) the point \\((x_0, y_0)\\) and sometimes write \\(P(x_0, y_0)\\). \\(x_0\\) is called the _x-coordinate_ of \\(P\\) and \\(y_0\\) the _y-coordinate_ of \\(P\\).

![figure 1.1.3](/calculus/img/keisler/f1.1.3.gif)

**Figure 1.1.3**

Conversely, given an ordered pair \\((x_0, y_0)\\) of real numbers there is a corresponding point \\(P(x_0, y_0)\\) in the plane. \\(P(x_0, y_0)\\) is the point of intersection of the vertical line crossing the x-axis at \\(x_0\\) and the horizontal line crossing the y-axis at \\(y_0\\). We have described a one-to-one correspondence between all points in the plane and all ordered pairs of real numbers.

From now on, we shall simplify things by identifying points in the plane with ordered pairs of real numbers, as shown in Figure 1.1.4.

![figure 1.1.4](/calculus/img/keisler/f1.1.4.gif)

**Figure 1.1.4**

## DEFINITION

_The \\((x, y)\\) **plane** is the set of all ordered pairs \\((x, y)\\) of real numbers. The **origin** is the point \\((0, 0)\\). The x**-axis** is the set of all points of the form \\((x, 0)\\), and the y**-axis** is the set of all points of the form \\((0, y)\\)._

The x- and y-axes divide the rest of the plane into four parts called _quadrants_. The quadrants are numbered I through IV, as shown in Figure 1.1.5.

![figure 1.1.5](/calculus/img/keisler/f1.1.5.gif)

**Figure 1.1.5** Quadrants

In Figure 1.1.6, \\(P(x_1 y_1)\\) and \\(Q(x_2, y_2)\\) are two different points in the \\((x, y)\\) plane. As we move from \\(P\\) to \\(Q\\), the coordinates \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) will change by amounts that we denote by \\(\Delta{x}\\) and \\(\Delta{y}\\). Thus

change in \\(x = \Delta{x} = x_2 - x_1\\),

change in \\(y = \Delta{y} = y_2 - y_1\\).

![figure 1.1.6](/calculus/img/keisler/f1.1.6.gif)

**Figure 1.1.6**

The quantities \\(\Delta{x}\\) and \\(\Delta{y}\\) may be positive, negative, or zero. For example, when \\(x_2 > x_1\\), \\(\Delta{x}\\) is positive, and when \\(x_2 < x_1\\), \\(\Delta{x}\\) is negative. Using \\(\Delta{x}\\) and \\(\Delta{y}\\) we define the basic notion of distance.

## DEFINITION

_The **distance** between the points_ \\(P(x_1, y_1)\\) _and_ \\(Q(x_2, y_2)\\) _is the quantity_

$$
distance \ (P, Q) = \sqrt{(\Delta{x})^2 + (\Delta{y})^2}
$$

$$
= \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}.
$$

When we square both sides of the distance formula, we obtain

$$
[distance \ (P, Q)]^2 = (\Delta{x})^2 + (\Delta{y})^2.
$$

One can also get this formula from the Theorem of Pythagoras in geometry: _The square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is the sum of the squares of the sides_.

### EXAMPLE 1

Find the distance between \\(P(7, 2)\\) and \\(Q(4, 6)\\) (see Figure 1.1.7).

$$
\Delta{x} = 4 - 7 = - 3,
$$

$$
\Delta{y} = 6 - 2 = 4.
$$

$$
distance \ (P, Q) = \sqrt{(-3)^2 + 4^2} = 5.
$$

We often deal with sets of points in the plane as well as on the line. One way to describe a set of points in the plane is by an equation or inequality in two variables, say \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). A solution of an equation in \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is a point \\((x_0, y_0)\\) in the plane for which the equation is true. The set of all solutions is called the _locus_, or _graph_, of the equation. The circle is an important example of a set of points in the plane.

![figure 1.1.7](/calculus/img/keisler/f1.1.7.gif)

**Figure 1.1.7**

## DEFINITION OF CIRCLE

_The set of all points in the plane at distance \\(r\\) from a point \\(P\\) is called the **circle** of **radius** \\(r\\) and **center** \\(P\\)._

Using the distance formula, we see that the circle of radius \\(r\\) and center at the origin (Figure 1.1.8) is the locus of the equation

$$
x^2 + y^2 = r^2.
$$

The circle of radius \\(r\\) and center at \\(P(h, k)\\) (Figure 1.1.8) is the locus of the equation

$$
(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2.
$$

![figure 1.1.8](/calculus/img/keisler/f1.1.8.gif)

**Figure 1.1.8**

For example, the circle with radius 3 and center at \\(P(2, -4)\\) has the equation

$$
(x - 2)^2 + (y + 4)^2 = 9.
$$
