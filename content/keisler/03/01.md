# 3.1 How to Set Up a Problem

In applications, a calculus problem is often presented verbally, and it is up to you to set up the problem in mathematical terms. The problem can usually be described mathematically by a list of equations and inequalities. The next two sections contain several examples that illustrate the process of setting up a problem. The examples in this section are from algebra and geometry, and those in the next section are from calculus.

It is sometimes hard to see how to begin on a story problem. It is helpful to break the process up into three steps:

_Step 1_

Draw a diagram if possible, and label all quantities involved.

_Step 2_

Write the given information as a set of equations and/or inequalities.

_Step 3_

Solve the mathematical problem, and interpret the mathematical solution to answer the original story problem.

### EXAMPLE 1

According to a treasure map, a buried treasure is located due east of a cave and is 200 paces from a tree. The tree is 30 paces east and 40 paces north of the cave. How far is the treasure from the cave?

The solution of this problem uses the quadratic formula, which will be needed throughout the calculus course. We review it here.

## Quadratic Formula

If \\(a \ne 0\\), then

$$
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
$$

if and only if

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.
$$

We solve Example 1 in three steps.

_Step 1_

Draw a diagram and label all quantities involved. In Figure 3.1.1, we put the cave at the origin and let \\(x\\) be the distance from the cave to the target along the x-axis. The tree is at the point \\((30, 40)\\), and the treasure is at the point \\((x, 0)\\).

**Figure 3.1.1**

_Step 2_

Write the known information as a system of formulas. By the distance formula, we have

$$
200 = \sqrt{(x - 30)^2 + (0 - 40)^2}, \ \ x \ge 0.
$$

The inequality \\(x \ge 0\\) arises because the treasure is east of the cave.

_Step 3_

Solve for \\(x\\), We square the Distance Formula.

$$
40,000 = (x - 30)^2 + (0 - 40)^2
$$

$$
= x^2 - 60x + 900 + 1600
$$

$$
= x^2 - 60x + 2500
$$

$$
x^2 - 60x - 37,500 = 0
$$

To find \\(x\\) we use the Quadratic Formula.

$$
x = \frac{60 \pm \sqrt{(60)^2 - 4(-37,500)}}{2}
$$

$$
= \frac{60 \pm \sqrt{153,600}}{2}
$$

$$
= 30 \pm \sqrt{38,400}
$$

### INTERPRET THE SOLUTION

Since \\(x \ge 0\\), we reject the negative solution. Thus \\(x = 30 + \sqrt{38,400} \sim 226\\) paces. The treasure is approximately 226 paces from the cave.

Most calculus problems involve two or more variables.

### EXAMPLE 2

A six-foot man stands near a ten-foot lamppost. Find the length of his shadow as a function of his distance from the lamppost.

_Step 1_

Draw a diagram and label all the quantities involved. In Figure 3.1.2, we let

\\(x\\) = man's distance from lamppost,

\\(s\\) = length of his shadow.

![figure 3.1.2](/calculus/img/keisler/f3.1.2.gif)

**Figure 3.1.2**

_Step 2_

Write the known information as a system of formulas. By similar triangles we have

$$
\frac{s}{6} = \frac{s + x}{10}, \ \ x \ge 0.
$$

The inequality \\(x \ge 0\\) arises because the distance cannot be negative.

_Step 3_

Solve for \\(s\\) as a function of \\(x\\).

$$
10s = 6s + 6x, 
$$

$$
4s = 6x,
$$

$$
s = \frac{3}{2}x.
$$

### INTERPRET THE SOLUTION

$$
s = \frac{3}{2}x, \ \ x \ge 0.
$$

The domain of the function is \\([0, \infty)\\). The length of the shadow is \\(\frac{3}{2}\\) times the distance from the lamppost. In this problem, \\(x\\) is the independent variable and \\(s\\) depends on \\(x\\).

### EXAMPLE 3

Two ships start at the same point at time \\(t = 0\\). One ship moves north at 30 miles per hour, while the other ship moves east at 40 miles per hour. Find the distance between the two ships as a function of time.

_Step 1_

The ships start at the origin; the y-axis points north; and the x-axis points east. The diagram is shown in Figure 3.1.3. \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the distances of the east- and north-moving ships from the origin, and \\(z\\) is the distance between the ships, all in miles, \\(t\\) is the time in hours.

![figure 3.1.3](/calculus/img/keisler/f3.1.3.gif)

**Figure 3.1.3**

_Step 2_

$$
t \ge 0, \ \ y = 30t, \ \ x = 40t, \ \ z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
$$

_Step 3_

$$
z = \sqrt{(30t)^2 + (40t)^2}
$$

$$
= \sqrt{2500t^2} = 50t.
$$

### INTERPRET THE SOLUTION

$$
z = 50t, \ \ t \ge 0.
$$

\\(t\\) is the independent variable, and \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(z\\) all depend on \\(t\\). The distance between the ships is \\(50t\\) miles, where \\(t\\) is the time in hours.

### EXAMPLE 4

A brush fire starts along a straight line segment of length 20 ft and expands in all directions at the rate of 2 ft per second. Find the burned out area as a function of time.

_Step 1_

\\(A\\) = total burned out area

\\(A_1\\) = area of left semicircle

\\(A_2\\) = area of central rectangle

\\(A_3\\) = area of right semicircle

\\(s\\) = distance of spread of fire

\\(t\\) = time

The diagram is shown in Figure 3.1.4.

![figure 3.1.4](/calculus/img/keisler/f3.1.4.gif)

**Figure 3.1.4**

_Step 2_

$$
s = 2t, \ \ t \ge 0.
$$

$$
A_1 = \frac{1}{2}\pi s^2, \ \ A_2 = 20(2s), \ \ A_3 = \frac{1}{2}\pi s^2.
$$

$$
A = A_1 + A_2 + A_3.
$$

_Step 3_

$$
A_1 = \frac{1}{2}\pi (2t)^2 = 2\pi t^2.
$$

$$
A_2 =20 \cdot 2 \cdot 2t = 80t.
$$

$$
A_3 = \frac{1}{2}\pi (2t)^2 = 2\pi t^2.
$$

$$
A = 2\pi t^2 + 80t + 2\pi t^2 = 4\pi t^2 + 80t.
$$

### INTERPRET THE SOLUTION

The burned out area is \\(A = 4\pi t^2 + 80t\\) sq ft, \\(t \ge 0\\), where \\(t\\) is time in seconds.

An algebraic identity that comes up frequently in calculus problems is

$$
(a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2.
$$

Sometimes it occurs in the form

$$
(\sqrt{a} - \sqrt{b})(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b}) = a - b.
$$

### EXAMPLE 5

The area of square \\(A\\) is twelve square units greater than the area of square \\(B\\), and the side of \\(A\\) is three units greater than the side of \\(B\\). Find the areas of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).

![figure 3.1.5](/calculus/img/keisler/f3.1.5.gif)

**Figure 3.1.5**

_Step 1_

Let \\(a\\) be the area of \\(A\\) and \\(b\\) the area of \\(B\\). See Figure 3.1.5.

_Step 2_

The sides of the squares have length \\(\sqrt{a}\\) and \\(\sqrt{b}\\) respectively. Thus

$$
a - b = 12, \sqrt{a} - \sqrt{b} = 3.
$$

_Step 3_

We find \\(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b}\\).

$$
(\sqrt{a} - \sqrt{b})(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b}) = a - b,
$$

$$
3(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b}) = 12,
$$

$$
\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} = 4.
$$

Adding the equations \\(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} = 4\\) and \\(\sqrt{a} - \sqrt{b} = 3\\), we obtain \\(2\sqrt{a} = 7\\), \\(\sqrt{a} = \frac{7}{2}\\), \\(a = \frac{49}{4}\\). Subtracting the equations gives \\(2\sqrt{b} = 1\\), \\(\sqrt{b} = \frac{1}{2}\\), \\(b = \frac{1}{4}\\).

### INTERPRET THE SOLUTION

The area of square \\(A\\) is \\(\frac{49}{4}\\) square units, and the area of square \\(B\\) is \\(\frac{1}{4}\\) square units.
