In this section we shall develop a method that will enable us to compute the slope of a curve by means of infinitesimals. We shall use the method to find slopes of curves in Chapter 2 and to find areas in Chapter 4. The key step will be to find the standard part of a given hyperreal number, that is, the real number that is infinitely close to it.

**DEFINITION**

_Two hyperreal numbers \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are said to be **infinitely close** to each other, in symbols \\(b \approx c\\), if their difference \\(b - c\\) is infinitesimal, \\(b \rlap{\,/}{\approx} c\\) means that \\(b\\) is not infinitely close to \\(c\\)._

Here are three simple remarks.

(1) _If \\(\varepsilon\\) is infinitesimal, then \\(b \approx b + \varepsilon\\)_. This is true because the difference, \\(b - (b + \varepsilon) = -\varepsilon\\), is infinitesimal.

(2) _\\(b\\) is infinitesimal if and only if \\(b \approx 0\\)_. The formula \\(b \approx 0\\) will be used as a short way of writing "\\(b\\) is infinitesimal."

(3)  _If \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are real and \\(b\\) is infinitely close to \\(c\\), then \\(b\\) equals \\(c\\)_. \\(b - c\\) is real and infinitesimal, hence zero; so \\(b = c\\).

The relation \\(\approx\\) between hyperreal numbers behaves somewhat like equality, but, of course, is not the same as equality. Here are three basic properties of \\(\approx\\).

**THEOREM 1**

_Let \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) be hyperreal numbers._

(i) _\\(a \approx a\\)._

(ii) _If \\(a \approx b\\), then \\(b \approx a\\)._

(iii) _If \\(a \approx b\\) and \\(b \approx c\\), then \\(a \approx c\\)._

These properties are useful when we wish to show that two numbers are infinitely close to each other.

The reason for (i) is that \\(a - a\\) is an infinitesimal, namely zero. For (ii), we note that if \\(a - b\\) is an infinitesimal \\(\varepsilon\\), then \\(b - a = -\varepsilon\\), which is also infinitesimal. Finally, (iii) is true because \\(a - c\\) is the sum of two infinitesimals, namely \\(a - b\\) and \\(b - c\\).

**THEOREM 2**

_Assume \\(a \approx b\\). Then_

(i) _If \\(a\\) is infinitesimal, so is \\(b\\)._

(ii) _If \\(a\\) is finite, so is \\(b\\)._

(iii) _If \\(a\\) is infinite, so is \\(b\\)._

The real numbers are sometimes called "standard" numbers, while the hyperreal numbers that are not real are called "nonstandard" numbers. For this reason, the real number that is infinitely close to \\(b\\) is called the "standard part" of \\(b\\). An infinite number cannot have a standard part, because it can't be infinitely close to a finite number (Theorem 2). Our third principle (stated next) on hyperreal numbers is that every finite number has a standard part.

**III. Standard Part Principle**

_Every finite hyperreal number is infinitely close to exactly one real number._

**DEFINITION**

_Let \\(b\\) be a finite hyperreal number. The **standard part** of \\(b\\), denoted by \\(st(b)\\), is the real number which is infinitely close to \\(b\\). Infinite hyperreal numbers do not have standard parts._

Here are some facts that follow at once from the definition. 

_Let \\(b\\) be a finite hyperreal number._

(1) _\\(st(b)\\) is a real number._

(2) _\\(b = st(b) + \varepsilon\\) for some infinitesimal \\(\varepsilon\\)._

(3) _If \\(b\\) is real, then \\(b = st(b)\\)._

Our next aim is to develop some skill in computing standard parts. This will be one of the basic methods throughout the Calculus course. The next theorem is the principal tool.

**THEOREM 3**

_Let \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) be finite hyperreal numbers. Then_

(i)	    _\\(st(-a) = -st(a)\\)._

(ii)	_\\(st(a + b) = st(a) + st(b)\\)._

(iii)	_\\(st(a - b) = st(a) - st(b)\\)._

(iv)	_\\(st(ab) = st(a) \cdot st(b)\\)._

(v)	    _If \\(st(b) \ne 0\\), then \\(st(a/b) = st(a)/st(b)\\)._

(vi)	_\\(st(a^n) = (st(a))^n\\)._

(vii)	_If \\(a \ge 0\\), then \\(st(\sqrt[n]{a}) = \sqrt[n]{st(a)}\\)._

(viii)	_If \\(a \le b\\), then \\(st(a) \le st(b)\\)._

This theorem gives formulas for the standard parts of the simplest expressions.

All of the rules in Theorem 3 follow from our three principles for hyperreal numbers. As an illustration, let us prove the formula (iv) for \\(st(ab)\\). Let \\(r\\) be the standard part of \\(a\\) and \\(s\\) the standard part of \\(b\\), so that

$$
a = r + \varepsilon,\ \ b = s + \delta,
$$

where \\(\varepsilon\\) and \\(\delta\\) are infinitesimal. Then

$$
ab = (r + \varepsilon)(s + \delta) 
$$

$$
= rs + r\delta + s\varepsilon + \varepsilon\delta \approx rs.
$$

Therefore

$$
st(ab) = rs = st(a) \cdot st(b).
$$

Often the symbols \\(\Delta{x}\\), \\(\Delta{y}\\), etc. are used for infinitesimals. In the following examples we use the rules in Theorem 3 as a starting point for computing standard parts of more complicated expressions.

**EXAMPLE 1**

When \\(\Delta{x}\\) is an infinitesimal and \\(x\\) is real, compute the standard part of

$$
3x^2 + 3x\ \Delta{x} + (\Delta{x})^2.
$$

Using the rules in Theorem 3, we can write

$$
st(3x^2 + 3x\ \Delta{x} + (\Delta{x})^2) =
$$

$$
= st(3x^2) + st(3x\ \Delta{x}) + st((\Delta{x})^2)
$$

$$
= 3x^2 + st(3x) \cdot st(\Delta{x}) + st(\Delta{x})^2
$$

$$
= 3x^2 + 3x \cdot 0 + 0^2 = 3x^2.
$$

**EXAMPLE 2**

If \\(st(c) = 4\\) and \\(c \ne 4\\), find

$$
st\Bigl(\frac{c^2 + 2c - 24}{c^2 - 16}\Bigr).
$$

We note that the denominator has standard part 0,

$$
st(c^2 - 16) = st\(c)^2 - 16 = 4^2 - 16 = 0.
$$

However, since \\(c \ne 4\\) the fraction is defined, and it can be simplified by factoring the numerator and denominator,

$$
\frac{c^2 + 2c - 24}{c^2 - 16} = \frac{(c + 6)(c - 4)}{(c + 4)(c - 4)} = \frac{c + 6}{c + 4}.
$$

Then

$$
st\Bigl(\frac{c^2 + 2c - 24}{c^2 - 16}\Bigr) = st\Bigl(\frac{c + 6}{c + 4}\Bigr) = \frac{st(c + 6)}{st(c + 4)}
$$

$$
= \frac{st\(c) + 6}{st\(c) + 4} = \frac{4 + 6}{4 + 4} = \frac{10}{8}.
$$

We now have three kinds of computation available to us. First, there are computations involving hyperreal numbers. In Example 2, the two steps giving

$$
\frac{c^2 + 2c - 24}{c^2 - 16} = \frac{c + 6}{c + 4}
$$

are computations of this kind. The computations of this first kind are justified by the Transfer Principle.

Second, we have computations which involve standard parts. In Example 2, the three steps giving

$$
st \frac{c^2 + 2c - 24}{c^2 - 16} = \frac{st\(c) + 6}{st\(c) + 4}
$$

are of this kind. This second kind of computation depends on Theorem 3.

Third there are computations with ordinary real numbers. Sometimes the real numbers will appear as standard parts. In Example 2, the last two steps which give

$$
\frac{st\(c) + 6}{st\(c) + 4} = \frac{10}{8}
$$

are computations with ordinary real numbers.

Usually, in computing the standard part of a hyperreal number, we use the first kind of computation, then the second kind, and then the third kind, in that order. We shall give two more somewhat different examples and pick out these three stages in the computations.

**EXAMPLE 3**

If \\(H\\) is a positive infinite hyperreal number, compute the standard part of

$$
c = \frac{2H^3 + 5H^2 - 3H}{7H^3 - 2H^2 + 4H}.
$$

In this example both the numerator and denominator are infinite, and we have to use the first type of computation to get the equation into a different form before we can take standard parts.

_First stage_

$$
c = \frac{2H^3 + 5H^2 - 3H}{7H^3 - 2H^2 + 4H}
$$

$$
= \frac{H^{-3} \cdot (2H^3 + 5H^2 - 3H)}{H^{-3} \cdot (7H^3 - 2H^2 + 4H)}
$$

$$
= \frac{2 + 5H^{-1} - 3H^{-2}}{7 - 2H^{-1} + 4H^{-2}}.
$$

_Second stage_ 

\\(H^{-1}\\) and \\(H^{-2}\\) are infinitesimal, so

$$
st\(c) = st\Bigl(\frac{2 + 5H^{-1} - 3H^{-2}}{7 - 2H^{-1} + 4H^{-2}}\Bigr)
$$

$$
= \frac{st(2 + 5H^{-1} - 3H^{-2})}{st(7 - 2H^{-1} + 4H^{-2})}
$$

$$
= \frac{st(2) + st(5H^{-1}) - st(3H^{-2})}{st(7) - st(2H^{-1}) + st(4H^{-2})}
$$

$$
= \frac{2 + 0 - 0}{7 - 0 + 0}.
$$

_Third stage_

$$
st\(c) = \frac{2 + 0 - 0}{7 - 0 + 0} = \frac{2}{7}.
$$

**EXAMPLE 4**

If \\(\varepsilon\\) is infinitesimal but not zero, find the standard part of

$$
b = \frac{\varepsilon}{5 - \sqrt{25 + \varepsilon}}.
$$

Both the numerator and denominator are nonzero infinitesimals. 

_First stage_ 

We multiply both numerator and denominator by \\(5 + \sqrt{25 + \varepsilon}\\).

$$
b = \frac{\varepsilon}{5 - \sqrt{25 + \varepsilon}} 
$$

$$
= \frac{\varepsilon(5 + \sqrt{25 + \varepsilon})}{(5 - \sqrt{25 + \varepsilon})(5 + \sqrt{25 + \varepsilon})}
$$

$$
= \frac{\varepsilon(5 + \sqrt{25 + \varepsilon})}{25 - (25 + \varepsilon)} = \frac{\varepsilon(5 + \sqrt{25 + \varepsilon})}{-\varepsilon}
$$

$$
= -5 - \sqrt{25 + \varepsilon}.
$$

_Second stage_

$$
st(b) = st(-5 - \sqrt{25 + \varepsilon})
$$

$$
= st(-5) - st(\sqrt{25 + \varepsilon})
$$

$$
= -5 - \sqrt{st(25 + \varepsilon)} = -5 - \sqrt{25}.
$$

_Third stage_

$$
st(b) = -5 - \sqrt{25} = -10.
$$

**EXAMPLE 5**

Remember that infinite hyperreal numbers do not have standard parts. Consider the infinite hyperreal number

$$
\frac{3 + \varepsilon}{4\varepsilon + \varepsilon^2},
$$

where \\(\varepsilon\\) is a nonzero infinitesimal. The numerator and denominator have standard parts

$$
st(3 + \varepsilon) = 3,\ \ st(4\varepsilon + \varepsilon^2) = 0.
$$

However, the quotient has no standard part. In other words,

$$
st\Bigl(\frac{3 + \varepsilon}{4\varepsilon + \varepsilon^2}\Bigr)
$$

is undefined.
